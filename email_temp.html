Hi saints,
<br><br>

This coming weekend we have the conference with brother Ron Kangas in Phoenix. There will be no Table Meeting or other meetings in 
Tucson this weekend, since hopefully many if not all of us will be able to attend the conference. Reminder to account for traffic
on Friday for the first meeting.<br><br>

We are on week 6 of the HWMR and will repeat week 6 next week for us to speak on after the conference.

<br><br>
In Him.
</p>
