Hi saints,
<br><br>

This week we begin week 1 of the new Holy Word for Morning Revival (HWMR). 
The links below are all updated for the associated audio messages, the HWMR book, and The Ministry of the Word for the printed messages. 
If you'd like a physical copy of the HWMR book, you can order your own or see brother Isaac Hsu.
<br><br>

We are canceling Monday night Life-study meetings for now due to needing that time for a weekly brothers' meeting. 
The rest of the schedule is to remain the same as normal.
<br><br>

Don't forget to sign up in the hall for tabling at the book fair! 
If you do not sign up, you are still welcome to come, but it's helpful for us 
to have a schedule as much as possible so that we can make sure we have enough saints there for the whole fair.

<br><br>
In Him.
</p>

        Saints generally can focus their speaking on their assigned day, but are not precluded from speaking on a different day
        if the Spirit inspires you with something. Anyone who is not yet in a group may speak on any day as the Spirit leads.
