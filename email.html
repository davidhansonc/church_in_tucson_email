Hi saints,
<br><br>

This week is our last week in the current morning revival book. Next week we will start Experiencing, Enjoying, and
Expressing Christ (2), vol. 4 from the recent December Training. The links to the Holy Word for Morning Revival book are updated 
below.
<br><br>

There is a need for ones to volunteer to serve at the upcoming Memorial Day conference. If anyone is willing and able 
sign up, please let one of the brothers know. Due to state laws, the ones coordinating for the conference are asking 
that only U.S. citizens volunteer due to a background check process that will be required. Also, if there are any 
more children that will need childcare, please fill out this 
<a href="https://form.jotform.com/243344327979165" style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">form</a>.

<br><br>
In Him.
</p>

        Saints generally can focus their speaking on their assigned day, but are not precluded from speaking on a different day
        if the Spirit inspires you with something. Anyone who is not yet in a group may speak on any day as the Spirit leads.
